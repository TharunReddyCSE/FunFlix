## Abstract

The Online movie streaming platform is a web-based system that is made using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, BOOTSTRAP, PHP, and MYSQL for the database. It contains two sides; The User side and the admin side. On the user side, the user can sign up/log in to watch their favorite movies, or web series anytime or anywhere. On the Admin side, the admin can either add or remove movies, or web series from the database. The admin controls what the user can see. The entire system is designed to be user-friendly.
